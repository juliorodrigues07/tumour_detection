# Brain Tumour Detector

Application of Machine Learning, AI and Data Mining methods, such as YOLOv8 model and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for building a model capable of detecting tumours in brain CT scans.

- We used a public dataset available in [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com) to develop the project. It's publicly available at the following link: [Medical Image DataSet: Brain Tumor Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pkdarabi/medical-image-dataset-brain-tumor-detection/data);

- We built the project based on an existing Jupyter notebook, also publicly available at Kaggle: [Brain Tumor Detection w/Keras YOLO V8](https://www.kaggle.com/code/banddaniel/brain-tumor-detection-w-keras-yolo-v8);

- Although the achieved results weren't satisfactory, we constructed a model which CIoU was almost 3x lower than the original model and a mAP almost 7x higher. The optimization tweaks also heavily reduced the training time (more than 6x faster); 

- If you want to see the deployed application, click down below and feel free to test the models with your own instances and visualize a static dashboard about the dataset:

# 3. Execution

In this section, you can follow detailed instructions for executing the project.

1. Clone the repository

       git clone https://github.com/juliorodrigues07/tumour_detection.git

2. Enter the repository's directory

       cd tumour_detection

2. Create a virtual environment

       python3 -m venv .venv

3. Activate the virtual environment

       source .venv/bin/activate

4. Install the dependencies

       pip install -r requirements.txt

## 3.1. Detector and Dashboard

- You first need to be in the _src_ directory to run the command:
     
      streamlit run 1_üè†_Home.py

## 3.2. Data Mining

- To visualize the notebooks online and run them ([Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/)), click on the following links:
    -  [EDA](https://colab.research.google.com/github/juliorodrigues07/tumour_detection/blob/master/notebooks/1_eda.ipynb);
    -  [Data Mining](https://colab.research.google.com/github/juliorodrigues07/tumour_detection/blob/master/notebooks/brain_tumor_detection_w_keras_yolo_v8.ipynb).
 
- To run the notebooks locally, run the commands in the _notebooks_ directory following the template: `jupyter notebook <file_name>.ipynb`.
  
    - EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis):

          jupyter notebook 1_eda.ipynb

    - Data Mining:

          jupyter notebook brain_tumor_detection_w_keras_yolo_v8.ipynb
