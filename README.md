# Brain Tumour Detection

Application of Machine Learning, AI and Data Mining methods, such as YOLOv8 model and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for building a model capable of detecting tumours in brain CT scans.

- We used a public dataset available in [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com) to develop the project. It's publicly available at the following link: [Medical Image DataSet: Brain Tumor Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pkdarabi/medical-image-dataset-brain-tumor-detection/data);

- We built the project based on a existing Jupyter notebook, also publicly available at Kaggle: [Brain Tumor Detection w/Keras YOLO V8](https://www.kaggle.com/code/banddaniel/brain-tumor-detection-w-keras-yolo-v8); 

- If you want to see the deployed application, click down below and feel free to test the models with your own instances and visualize a static dashboard about the dataset:

     - **Deploy**: [![Deploy](https://img.shields.io/website-up-down-green-red/http/monip.org.svg)](https://tumour_detection.streamlit.app/)

# 3. Execution

In this section, you can follow detail instructions for executing the project.

1. Clone the repository

       git clone https://github.com/juliorodrigues07/tumour_detection.git

2. Enter the repository's directory

       cd tumour_detection

2. Create a virtual environment

       python3 -m venv .venv

3. Activate the virtual environment

       source .venv/bin/activate

4. Install the dependencies

       pip install -r requirements.txt

5. You first need to be in the _src_ directory to run the command:
     
      streamlit run 1_üè†_Home.py
      
# 4. Project Structure

    .
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md                             <- Project's documentation
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt                      <- File containing all the required dependencies to run the project
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ src                                   # Directory containing the web application
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 1_üè†_Home.py                      <- Main page with the tumour detector
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ pages                             # Child pages directory
            ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 2_üìä_Static.py                <- Script responsible for generating the static dashboard

# 5. Outro

- To uninstall all dependencies, run the following command:

      pip uninstall -r requirements.txt -y

- To deactivate the virtual environment, run the following command:

      deactivate

- To delete the virtual environment, run the following command:

      rm -rf .venv
